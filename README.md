# Prerequisites

Node v10+

# TODO 
- [ ] Logging
- [ ] Error handling
- [ ] Model setup
- [ ] Lots more no doubt...

# Running the application

First build the application using:

`$ npm run build`

This builds the `govuk-frontend` sass.  Going forwards this may be extended to include other build tasks as needed (e.g. client-side js using browserify or webpack etc.)

Now the application is ready to run:

`$ node index`

Check the server is running by pointing your browser to `http://localhost:3000`

## Project structure

Here's the default structure for your project files.

* **bin** (build tasks)
* **client** (client js/sass code)
* **server**
  * **models**
  * **modules** (Feature based modules that include routes and views)
  * **plugins** (Hapi and custom plugins)
  * **public**  (This folder is publicly served)
    * **static** (Put all static assets in here)
    * **build** (This contains the build output files (js/css etc.) and is not checked-in)
  * config.js
  * index.js (Exports a function that creates a server)
* **test**
* LICENCE
* README.md
* index.js (startup server)

## Config

The configuration file for the server is found at `server/config.js`.
This is where to put any config.  All environment-specific config should be read from the environment (or a `.env` file)

# Environment variables

| name                      | description      | required | default      |            valid            | notes |
|---------------------------|------------------|:--------:|---------     |:---------------------------:|-------|
| NODE_ENV                  | Node environment |    no    | development  | development,test,production |       |
| PORT                      | Port number      |    no    | 3000         |                             |       |

TODO: Add the address lookup variables; ADDRESS_LOOKUP_URI 
ADDRESS_LOOKUP_USERNAME, 
ADDRESS_LOOKUP_PASSWORD, 
ADDRESS_LOOKUP_KEY, 
ADDRESS_LOOKUP_STUB

## Plugins

hapi has a powerful plugin system and all server code should be loaded in a plugin.

Plugins live in the `server/plugins` directory.

## Logging

The [good](https://github.com/hapijs/good) and [good-console](https://github.com/hapijs/good-console) plugins are included and configured in `server/plugins/logging`

The logging plugin is only registered in when `NODE_ENV=development`.

Error logging for production should use errbit.

## Views

The [vison](https://github.com/hapijs/vision) plugin is used for template rendering support.

The template engine used in nunjucks inline with the GDS Design System with support for view caching, layouts, partials and helpers.

## Static files

The [Inert](https://github.com/hapijs/inert) plugin is used for static file and directory handling in hapi.js.
Put all static assets in `server/public/static`.

Any build output should write to `server/public/build`. This path is in the `.gitignore` and is therefore not checked into source control.

## Routes

Incoming requests are handled by the server via routes. 
Each route describes an HTTP endpoint with a path, method, and other properties.

Routes are found within their relevant feature/module in the `server/modules` directory and loaded using the `server/plugins/router.js` plugin.

There are lots of [route options](http://hapijs.com/api#route-options), here's the documentation on [hapi routes](http://hapijs.com/tutorials/routing)

## Tasks

Build tasks are created using simple shell scripts or node.js programs.
The default ones are found in the `bin` directory.

The task runner is simply `npm` using `npm-scripts`.

We chose to use this for simplicity but there's nothing to stop you adding `gulp`, `grunt` or another task runner if you prefer. 

The predefined tasks are:

- `npm run build` (Runs all build sub-tasks)
- `npm run build:css` (Builds the client-side sass)
- `npm run lint` (Runs the lint task using standard.js)
- `npm run unit-test` (Runs the `lab` tests in the `/test` folder)
- `npm test` (Runs the `lint` task then the `unit-tests`)

## Testing

[lab](https://github.com/hapijs/lab) and [code](https://github.com/hapijs/code) are used for unit testing.

See the `/test` folder for more information.

## Linting

[standard.js](http://standardjs.com/) is used to lint both the server-side and client-side javascript code.

It's defined as a build task and can be run using `npm run lint`.
